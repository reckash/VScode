"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized
by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the paint and trouble 
hat are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, 
hich is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and paint. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able
to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every paint avoided. But in certain circumstances
and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to
be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle
of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
pains."
